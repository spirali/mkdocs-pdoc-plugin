# mkdocs-pdoc-plugin

This is a [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) plugin for linking to API documentation generated by
[pdoc](https://pdoc.dev/) from `mkdocs`.

This plugin is inspired by https://github.com/Kobzol/mkdocs-nedoc-plugin

# Usage
1) Install `mkdocs-pdoc-plugin`

    ```commandline
    $ python3 -m pip install git+https://github.com/spirali/mkdocs-pdoc-plugin
    ```

2) Generate documentation with `pdoc` into directory with mkdoc's markdown files. 

    ```commandline
    $ pdoc mypackage -o docs/<PATH_TO_API>
    ```


3) Configure plugin in `mkdocs.yaml`

    ```yaml
    plugins:
      - pdoc:
          api_path: <PATH_TO_API>
    ```

    `api_path` has to be a relative path where to find generated documentation in the documentation directory. 

 
4) Link to code in `mkdocs` documentation. Link has to start with "pdoc:"
 
    ```
    The [MyClass](pdoc:mypackage.MyClass) class is awesome.
    The [do_something](pdoc:mypackage.MyClass.do_something) method is awesome.
    ```

    You can omit title:
    
    ```
    The [](mypackage.MyClass) class is awesome.
    ```
    
    and the last part of the name will be used as the title (`MyClass` in this case)
